Airplanes Project
==============

also known as the 'architect project'
---

My aim is to create a program that models planes taking off/landing at an airport. Weather conditions are taken into account.

More details can be found in the task_outline file.

The program is written in Ruby and is test driven.

At this stage, I am finishing my third week of learning Ruby at Makers Academy.
