task outline:

 - Write software that controls the flow of planes at an airport.
 - The weather is usually sunny and only occasionally stormy.
 - Planes can only take off when it's sunny.
 - Every plane needs to have a status indicator (flying/not flying)


 code specific things:

 	- need to use random number generator to set weather
 	- need to use double to override random weather
 	- separate file for each class, module & test suite

 judged on:

 	- tests pass
 	- coverage
 	- elegance: class has clear responsibility, short methods

 PLANES 
 - are made in the air. Not in the airport.
